# Start Here - BuilderHub Mobile

## Quick Start

This is a **COMPLETELY NEW** Flutter app with BuilderHub branding and Burkina Faso colors.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd builderhub_mobile
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

## What You'll See

### Auth Screen

- Green and Yellow accents

### Home Screen
- **Red AppBar** with "BuilderHub" title
- Category cards in **Green, Yellow, and Red**
- Top-rated artisans section

## No More Purple!

This app uses ONLY Burkina Faso flag colors:
- 🔴 Red (#EF2B2D)
- 🟢 Green (#00A651)
- 🟡 Yellow (#FCD116)

## Features Included

✅ BuilderHub branding throughout
✅ Beautiful auth screen
✅ Home with categories
✅ Supabase authentication
✅ Same database as web app
✅ No purple or old "Artisan BF" branding

## If You Still See Old Design

Make sure you're running from the `builderhub_mobile` folder, not `flutter_app`:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right folder
pwd
# Should show: .../builderhub_mobile

# Then run
flutter run
```

## Folder Comparison

- `flutter_app/` - OLD app (has purple colors and "Artisan BF")
- `builderhub_mobile/` - NEW app (BuilderHub with Burkina Faso colors) ✅

Use `builderhub_mobile` from now on!
